# Adidas Challange Test - Felipe Passos

Solution for Adidas Coding Challenge

## Getting Started

## Environment Requirements 

* Gradle 4.x or newer
* Docker 17.x or newer
* Have Lombok plugin installed in your IDE to avoid seeing compile errors

## Setup Stream Server

[Landoop](https://github.com/Landoop/fast-data-dev) has a full docker image with Kafka and Zookeeper, including UI tools. Then we'll use to provide a stream server.

Create `landoop` docker-machine

```
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 4096 landoop
```

Run `docker-machine ls` to verify that the Docker Machine is running correctly. The command's output should be similar to:

```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME        ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
landoop     *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v17.03.1-ce
```

Configure your terminal to be able to use the new Docker Machine named landoop:

```
$ eval $(docker-machine env landoop)
```

And run the Kafka Development Environment. Define ports, advertise the hostname and use extra parameters:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 \
       -p 9581-9585:9581-9585 -p 9092:9092 -e ADV_HOST=192.168.99.100 \
       landoop/fast-data-dev:latest
```

That's it. Visit http://192.168.99.100:3030 to get into the fast-data-dev environment

## Build

```
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

## Run

```
$ build && docker-compose up --build
```

 ## Libs

##### Kafka
    It's is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. 
    The app uses Kafka to sends events between Command service and Processor service.
#### Spring Boot Dependencies
    It's third part library from Spring suite tools to manager spring dependencies.
##### Spring Cloud Stream
    It's a is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected 
    with shared messaging systems.
##### Spring Boot Web Starter
    Starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring. Uses Tomcat as the default embedded container
##### Spring Boot Actuator    
    It's is a sub-project of Spring Boot. It adds several production grade services to your application with little effort on your part. 
    In this guide, youâ€™ll build an application and then see how to add these services.
#### Neo4j
    It's a graph database used to keep the data in way to run the Breadth First Search algorithm.
##### Swagger
